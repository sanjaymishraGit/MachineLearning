# Mean Shift -  Finding gropus in Titanic Data set 

There is some degree of randomness here, so your results may not be the same. You can probably re-run the program to get similar data.
however.

We're going to take a look at the Titanic dataset via clustering with Mean Shift. What we're interested to know is whether or not Mean Shift will automatically separate passengers into groups or not. If so, it will be interesting to inspect the groups that are created. The first obvious curiosity will be the survival rates of the groups found, but, then, we will also poke into the attributes of these groups to see if we can understand why the Mean Shift algorithm decided on the specific groups.
