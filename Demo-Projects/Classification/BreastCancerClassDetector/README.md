# Breast Cancer Prediction
In this example, we're actually going to apply a simple example of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Scikit-Learn/
I will be using a Breast Cancer Dataset, which is a dataset donated to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) collection from the University of Wisconsin-Madison

We will be predicting if sample data classes are going to leads to a benign or malignant tumor
